## Hey, what's up? 😁

So, i'm Guilherme Rodrigues. I'm Brazilian, but i can speak and understand pretty much everything in english (Just don't hit me with "thy"💀).
I'm currently working on a modular and costumizable "NeoVim Emulator" on WEB. To do that, i'll use javaScript, that's what i'm learning right now.
I'm working on another side project actually, but i'll talk about it in another time.

For anyone that is asking, i can programm in a lot of different languages. And some of them are:

  - Java (Some interfaces and some simple projects)
  - Python (Automation and Machine Learning)
  - Lua (Automation and some other stuff)
  - Ruby (Server CRUD and cofiguration)

I love to code and i also like some RPG (I do have a System just for my campains...) and Games, but, even if these other hobbies, i'm mostly focused in coding.

I have a dream, and i'm going to chase it until i reach it.
